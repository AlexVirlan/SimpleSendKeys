# What is this?
Have you ever found yourself in a situation where you can't use the `copy-paste` functionality? Eg. some [RDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol) connections (or apps) have it disabled. And it sucks!
SSK tries to solve this by allowing you to set a text payload (or it can sync to your keyboard - see the "recommended use" section below) and send each character as if you typed it.


# Recommended use


# Dependencies
- [.NET Desktop Runtime 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) - no need to download this yourself, it will be included in the release.
